//* Personal Checklist - Glonel

//TODO Check if package.json is present. 
//* If yes, run npm install
    //* double check the package.json has express installed. 
    //* If yes, you're all set.
    //* Otherwise, run npm install express
//* If not, run npm init --yes
    //* Then run npm install express

//TODO Under package.json/scripts, check to see if "start" is present.
//* Make sure it looks like this: "start": "node server/server.js"
    //* If it is not present, make it present.
    //* This will allow the terminal to run server with: npm start
    //* instead of using: node server/server.js

//TODO USING AXIOS.
//* Inside public HTML file, above your script src for the client.js, 
//* make sure that the script src for the axios library is sourced. 
//* Use this code to get it sourced:
//* <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/axios/dist/axios.min.js"></script>

//TODO make .gitignore file
//* If you don't see one, make sure you have a .gitignore file in the main folder
//* alongside your package.json and node_modules
    //* within that folder, make sure that you include:
    //* node_modules/
    //* .DS_Store

//TODO Setting Up the Server in server.js
//* This is going to be the code you will copy and make sure is 
//* present in ALL projects regarding servers for localhost:5001 at least.
